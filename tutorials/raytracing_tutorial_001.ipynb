    "# How to raytrace?\n",
    "This tutorial is targetting to introduce a library called `odak`, and show how one can use `odak` for raytracing purposes. Author of this tutorial is [Kaan AkÅŸit](https://kaanaksit.com), for questions please reach out to him through [email](kunguz@gmail.com). Note that this tutorial assumes, you have a reasonable knowledge on raytracing in general, programming with `Python` and `Jupyter notebooks`. The target audience of this tutorial are people interested in raytracing in general, and want to use it for solving optical problems."

    "For this tutorial one needs a `Python>=3.6.7`, `Numpy>=1.5.1`, `matplotlib>=2.1.1`, `git>=2.17.1`, and `odak`, entire tutorial is verified using an `Ubuntu 18.04` at `4.15.0-46-generic`. Note that I won't be explaining how to install all these libraries as your favorite search engine can lead you to tons of examples of doing that.\n",

    "For the sake of stability, I will now explain how does one clone and use a specific version of `odak`. Start a shell using your linux operating system, and generate two folders as follows:\n",

    "Commit number of Odak used in this tutorial is `14c061e6e01c977e83077fc1f6e371d7aa40f7d9`, in case you want to use that specific version.\n",

    "### How to run this tutorial?\n",
    "Now that, you have a folder named as `raytracing`, first navigate to that `raytracing` main directory. Make sure that this tutorial `raytracing_tutorial_001.ipynb` is inside this main folder of `raytracing`, if not please copy it , and start running this tutorial. You can do so either using your own methods or Jupyter's main page."

    "# Step 2: Anatomy of a ray\n",
    "I will try to explain what is a ray in mathematical means, yes, it is a line in between two dots. However, how would you describe that to a computer? You may provide two points and store them, which may be the most simplistic way. I will first explain why storing two points is a bad idea in the first place. You are likely to be asking this ray to refract, reflect or diffract or may be interfere in some cases. Let's think about [Snell's refraction law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell's_law) that formulation is purely based on the angles, and location of the hit of a ray. Therefore, two points would always require a conversion to finding angle of a particular ray, why not doing that in the first place as you define a ray. Therefore, most common description of a ray is a start point, and directions  defined along X,Y, and Z axes in cosines form. Luckily, there is a very good and very old manuscript on showing the benefits of such a definition: **G.H. Spencer and M.V.R.K. Murty, \"General Ray-Tracing Procedure\", 1961**."

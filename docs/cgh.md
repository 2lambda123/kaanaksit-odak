# Computer-Generated Holography
Odak contains essential ingredients for research and development targeting Computer-Generated Holography.
We consult the beginners in this matter to `Goodman's Introduction to Fourier Optics` book (ISBN-13:  978-0974707723) and `Principles of optics: electromagnetic theory of propagation, interference and diffraction of light` from Max Born and Emil Wolf (ISBN 0-08-26482-4).
In the rest of this document, you will find engineering notes and relevant functions in Odak that helps you describing complex nature of light on a computer.

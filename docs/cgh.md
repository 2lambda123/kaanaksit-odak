# Computer-Generated Holography
Odak contains essential ingredients for research and development targeting Computer-Generated Holography.
We consult the beginners in this matter to `Goodman's Introduction to Fourier Optics` book (ISBN-13:  978-0974707723) and `Principles of optics: electromagnetic theory of propagation, interference and diffraction of light` from Max Born and Emil Wolf (ISBN 0-08-26482-4).
In the rest of this document, you will find engineering notes and relevant functions in Odak that helps you describing complex nature of light on a computer.
Note that, the creators of this documentation are from `Computational Displays` domain, however the provided submodules can potentially aid other lines of research as well, such as `Computational Imaging` or `Computational Microscopy`.

## Engineering notes

| Note          | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [`Holographic light transport`](notes/holographic_light_transport.md) | This engineering note will give you an idea about how coherent light propagates in free space. |
| [`Optimizing phase-only single plane holograms using Odak`](notes/optimizing_holograms_using_odak.md) | This engineering note will give you an idea about how to calculate phase-only holograms using Odak. |
| [`Learning the model of a holographic display`](https://github.com/complight/realistic_holography) | This link navigates to a project website that provides a codebase that can learn the model of a holographic display using a single complex kernel. |
| [`Optimizing three-dimensional multiplane holograms using Odak`](https://github.com/complight/realistic_defocus) | This link navigates to a project website that provides a codebase that can help optimize a phase-only hologram representing multiplanar three-dimensional scenes. |

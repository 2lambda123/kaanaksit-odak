Welcome to the odak's documentation!

Odak (pronounced "O-dawec") is the fundamental library for scientific computing in optical sciences. Odak includes modules for geometric [3D raytracing](odak/raytracing/), 2D paraxial raytracing, Jones calculus, beam propagation, and [wave optics](odak/wave) among with [a set of tools](odak/tools) to ease your pain in measurement, [exporting/importing CAD](odak/tools/asset.py), and visualization during a design process. We have created a bunch of [test scripts](test/), a complete documentation, [recordings](recordings) and tutorials for inspiring the way you use odak and helping your design process. For computationally expensive tasks, we have created a distribution system to process tasks in parallel across multiple computing resources within the same network.

# Machine learning
Odak provides a set of function that implements classical methods in machine learning.
Note that these functions are typically basing on `Numpy`.
Thus, they do not take advantage from automatic differentiation found in `Torch`.
The soul reason why these functions exists is because they stand as an example for impelementing basic methods in machine learning.

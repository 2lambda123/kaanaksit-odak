# odak.wave.rotationspeed

`rotationspeed(wavelength,c=3*10**11)`

Definition for calculating rotation speed of a wave (w in A*e^(j(wt+phi))).
 
**Parameters:**

    wavelength   : float
                   Wavelength of a wave in mm.
    c            : float
                   Speed of wave in mm/seconds. Default is the speed of light in the void!
                       
**Returns**

    w            : float

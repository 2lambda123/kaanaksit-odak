# Light, Computation, and Computational Light
We can establish an understanding of the term `Computational Light` as we explore the term `light` and its relation to `computation.`


## What is light?
Light surrounds us; we see the light and swim in the sea of light.
It is indeed a daily matter that we interact by opening our window to see what is outside, turning on the lights of a room, looking at our displays, taking pictures of our loved ones, or walking in a night lit by moonlight.
It is something that we all know, but we need help explaining.
Here, we will first establish some basic scientific knowledge about light, which will help us understand why it is essential for the future of technology.

Light is electromagnetic radiation, often considered as a bundle of particles named photons, first coined by Gilbert Lewis in 1926.
For anything to be electromagnetic, it must have electric and magnetic fields.


??? question end "Where can I learn more about electric and magnetic fields?"
    Beware that the topic of electric and magnetic fields deserves its courses and has many details.
    As an undergraduate student, back in the day, I learned about electric and magnetic fields by following a dedicated class and reading this book: `Cheng, David Keun. "Fundamentals of engineering electromagnetics." (1993).`


??? question end "What is a photon?"
    Let me adjust this question a bit: `What model is good for describing a photon?`
    There is literature describing a photon as a single particle, and there are also works showing that it could be described as a pack of particles.
     Suppose you want a more profound understanding than stating that it is a particle. 
    In that case, you may want to dive deep into existing models in relation to the relativity concept: `Roychoudhuri, C., Kracklauer, A. F., & Creath, K. (Eds.). (2017). The nature of light: What is a photon?. CRC Press.`


Let us start with this simple drawing below to explain the characteristics of this electromagnetic radiation, light.
Note that this figure depicts a photon at the origin of XYZ axes.
But bear in mind that a photon's shape, weight, and characteristics are yet to be fully discovered and remain an open research question.
Beware that the figure depicts a photon as a sphere to provide ease of understanding.

??? question end "Where can I find basic information about optics and light?"
    As a graduate student, back in the day, I learned the basics of optics by reading this book without following any course: `Hecht, E. (2012). Optics. Pearson Education India.`

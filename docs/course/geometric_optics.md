# Modeling light with rays


Modeling of light plays a crucial role in describing events based on light and designing mechanisms based on light (e.g., Realistic graphics in a video game or camera).
This chapter introduces the most basic description of light using geometric rays, also known as raytracing.
As we provide algorithmic examples to support our descriptions, readers should be able to simulate light on their computers.


??? question end "Are there other good resources on modeling light with rays?"
    When I first started coding Odak, the first paper I read was on raytracing. 
    Thus, I recommend that paper for any starter:
    
    * [Spencer, G. H., and M. V. R. K. Murty. "General ray-tracing procedure." JOSA 52, no. 6 (1962): 672-678.](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.52.000672)
    
    Beyond this paper, there are several resources that I can recommend for curious readers:
    
    * [Shirley, Peter. "Ray tracing in one weekend." Amazon Digital Services LLC 1 (2018): 4.](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf)
    * [Morgan McGuire (2021). The Graphics Codex. Casual Effects.](https://graphicscodex.com/)

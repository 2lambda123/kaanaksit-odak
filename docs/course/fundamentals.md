This chapter will review some background information you will likely use in the rest of this course.
In addition, we will also introduce you to a structure where we establish some standards to decrease the chances of producing buggy or incompatible codes.

We have provided some information in [prerequisites](index.md).
This information includes programming language requirements, required libraries, text editors, build environments, and operating system requirements.
For installing our library, odak, we strongly advise using the version in the source repository.
You can install odak from the source repository using your favorite terminal and operating system:


```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak
```

Note that your production environment meaning your computer and required software for this course is important.
To avoid wasting time in the next chapters and get the most from this lecture, please ensure that you have dedicated enough time to set everything up as it should.

# Prerequisites and general information
This page is the starting point for the **Computational Light** course.
Readers can follow the course material found on these pages to learn more about the field of **Computational Light**.
I encourage readers to carefully read this page to decide if they want to continue with the course.


## Prerequisites
These are the prerequisites of **Computational Light** course:


- **Background knowledge.** First and foremost being fluent in programming with [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and a graduate-level understanding of `Linear Algebra,` and  `Machine Learning` are highly required.
- **Skills and abilities.** Throughout the entire course, three libraries will be used, and these libraries include [`odak`](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak), [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), and [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/).
Familiarity with these libraries is a big plus.
- **Required Resources.** Readers need a computer with decent computational resources (e.g., GPU) when working on the provided materials, laboratory work, and projects. 
Note that at each section of the course, you will be provided with relevant reading materials on the spot.
- **Expectations.** Readers also need sustainable motivation to learn new things related to the topics of `Computational Light,` and willing to advance the field by developing, innovating and researching. 
In other terms, you are someone motivated to create a positive impact in the society with light related innovations. 
You can also be someone eager to understand and learn physics behind light and how you can simulate light related phenomena.


## Questions and Answers
Here are some questions and answers related to the course that readers may ask:

??? question end "How can I learn Python programming, linear Algebra and machine learning?"
    There isn't a point in providing references on how to learn `Python programming,` `Linear Algebra,` and `Machine Learning` as there is a vast amount of resources online or in your previous university courses.


??? question end "How do I install Python, numpy and torch?"
    The installation guide for [python](https://www.python.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [torch](https://pytorch.org/) is also available on their websites.


??? question end "How do I install odak?"
      Odak's [installation page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/odak/installation/) and [README](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak) provide the most up-to-date information on installing odak.
      But in a nutshell, all you need is to use the following command in a terminal `pip3 install odak` for the latest version, or if you want to install the latest code from the source, use `pip3 install git+https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak`.

??? question end "Which Python environment and operating system should I use?"
    I use the Python distribution shipped with a traditional Linux distribution.
    Again, there isn't no one correct answer here for everyone.
    You can use any operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac) and Python distribution (e.g., conda).


??? question end "Which text editor should I use for programming?"
    I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as my text editor.
    However, I understand that `vim` could be challenging to adopt, especially as a newcomer.
    The pattern I observe among collaborators and students is that they use [Microsoft's Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), a competent text editor with artificial intelligence support through subscription and works across various operating systems.
    I encourage you to make your choice depending on how comfortable you are with sharing your data with companies.
    Please also remember that I am only making suggestions here.
    If another text editor works better for you, please use that one (e.g., nano, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, Jupyter Notebooks).


???+ question end "How to cite this course?"
    For citing using latex's bibtex bibliography system:
    ```bibtex
    @book{aksit2024computationallight,
      title = {Computational Light},
      author = {Ak{\c{s}}it, Kaan},
      booktitle = {Computational Light Course},
      year = {2024}
    }
    ```
    For plain text citation: `Kaan Akşit, "Computational Light Course", 2024.`

# Introduction to Computational Light
This page is the starting point for the `Computational Light` course.
Online readers or actual students can follow the course material found on these pages to learn more about the field of `Computational Light.`
[Kaan Ak≈üit](https://kaanaksit.com) designed the `Computational Light` course such that a linear read through the materials (top to down) has to provide a good understanding of the matter to a reader.

!!! Warning end "Prerequisites"
    The `Computational Light` course requires several prerequisites.
    These prerequisites involve being fluent in programming with [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and a graduate-level understanding of `Linear Algebra,` `Mathematics,` `Machine Learning,` and `Deep Learning.`
    Throughout the entire course, three libraries will be used, and these libraries include [`odak`](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak), [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) and [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/).
    Familiarity with these libraries is a big plus but not a must.

## Light, Computation, and Computational Light
We can establish an understanding of the term `Computational Light` as we explore the terms `light` and `computation.`
Let us start this excursion by asking the first question `What is light?`

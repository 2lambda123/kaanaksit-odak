# Computer-Generated Holography


In this section, we introduce Computer-Generated Holography (CGI) [@born2013principles, @goodman2005introduction]  as another emerging method to simulate light.
CGI offers an upgraded but more computationally expensive way to simulation concerning the raytracing method described in the previous section.
This section dives deep into CGI and will explain on the fly how CGI differs from raytracing as we go.
However, you may be wondering about the greater physical details of CGI.
In this case, we suggest our readers watch the video below.


??? question end "Where can I find an extensive summary on CGI?"
    Please watch this video for an extensive summary on CGI [@kavakli2022optimizing].

??? tip end "Did you know?"
    There is an active repository on GitHub, where latest CGI papers relevant to display technologies are listed.

Odak (pronounced "O-dawec") is the fundamental library for scientific computing in optical sciences. Odak includes modules for geometric [3D raytracing](odak/raytracing/), ~~2D paraxial raytracing~~, ~~Jones calculus~~, ~~beam propagation~~, and ~~wave optics~~ among with [a set of tools](odak/tools) to ease your pain in ~~measurement~~, [exporting/importing CAD](odak/tools/asset.py), and ~~visualization~~ during a design process. We have created a bunch of [test scripts](test/), a complete ~~documentation~~, [recordings](recordings) and ~~tutorials~~ for inspiring the way you use odak and helping your design process. For computationally expensive tasks, we have created a ~~distribution system~~ to process tasks in parallel across multiple computing resources within the same network.

## Getting Started

### Installing
Odak can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip):

```bash
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ odak
```

### Usage
It is easy as in this recorded session. Import it to your code and start designing your next in Optics!
